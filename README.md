This app is a short game based on the D&D fighter class.  Once past the intro, you'll drag and drop randomly generated stats into desired category target containers to maximize your character as you see fit.  In the following stage your new character will combat "Bad Guy" using self explanatory buttons to activate turn-based abilities.  There are also some basic animations and some well beyond basic sound effects provided by my sons, J-bug and Goofball Jr.
